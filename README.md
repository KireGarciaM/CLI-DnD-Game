# CLI DnD Game
Dungeons & Dragons inspired CLI game written in C++

## Setup and Testing
Personally, I used **MinGW Distribution** from https://nuwen.net/mingw.html to compile C++ on VS Code. 

You may also include the latest Code Runner extension in VS Code to have an easier time running the code. 
  - Optional: enable "code-runner.runInTerminal" in Code Runner extension setting to have your code run on your terminal

Here's a great video setup guide if you need it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvg4VtYEhKU

Alternatively, you could also use **Visual Studio Community Edition 2022 (IDE)** from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ with "Desktop development with C++" package installed and it should work right out of the box.

## Coding Standards
Anything works as long as the code is:
  - written in C++
  - organized and consistent

We want to focus on readability and maintainability so if you keep those in mind then that's perfect!
